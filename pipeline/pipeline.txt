class Vertex_3D:
	specifies each vertex's 3 coordinates by 4 demenstions;
	this also specifies current vertex's color.

c_color:
	first 8 bits store red
	second 8 bits store green
	last 8 bit store blue

class Matrix
	uses a 16 bit array to store a 4 by 4 matrix.
	has very useful helper function --> overloaded * and =

class Triangle
	stores a triangle's three vertices

current_mode is a flag for current matrix mode
poly_mode is a flag for current polynomial's mode

modelviewStack, projectionStack
	stacks to record the history of modelview transformation matrix and projection tranformation matrix

currentMatrix_pointer:
	a pointer pointing to the current using matrix, it will change with matix mode

obj_vertices
	it contains all the vertices from each object

vertices_tri
	contians all the triangles, including the implicit triangles from a quadriangle;


screenCoordinates():
	translate vertices' coordinates to screen coordinates

lineEquation()
	implicit line function
	used to compute alpha, beta, gamma

function mglReadPixels:
	for each triangles(including imlicit ones), 
	compute the coresponding color for this triangle fragments
	by looping over the whole screen space.
	if the current pixel's depth is smaller than the pixel's previous depth value,
	update this pixel's color



mglBegin:
	Set the polynomial Mode for next polynomial.

mglEnd:
	stores all the  triangles


mglVertex3:
	compute vertex's coordinats

mglMatrixMode:
	set current mode
	update currentMatix_pointer

mglPushMatrix:
	push current matrix into the coresponding stack
	update currentMatix_pointer

mglPopMatrix:
	pop current mode's stack
	update currentMatix_pointer

mglLoadIdentity:
	unnessary for my work ^.^

mglLoadMatrix:
	unnessary for my work ^.^

mglMultMatrixRight:
	multiply the current matrix with the given one
	update currentMatix_pointer with the result


mglTranslate, mglRotate, mglScale:
	update current matrix to the cooresponding transformed matrix

mglFrustum, mglOrtho:
	update current matrix to the cooresponding projection coordinats

mglColor:
	set given pixel's color
